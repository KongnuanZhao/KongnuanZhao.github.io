最后，以看到的一个笑话结束本篇的整理，只有程序猿童鞋才能看懂的奥~大家感受一下：
“我给你讲一个 TCP 的笑话吧？”

“给我讲一个 TCP 笑话呗！”

“好的，我会给你讲一个TCP 的笑话。 ”

英文版：
"Hi, I’d like to hear a TCP joke."

"Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I’d like to hear a TCP joke."

"OK, I’ll tell you a TCP joke."

"Ok, I will hear a TCP joke."

"Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I am ready to hear a TCP joke."

"Ok, I am about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has two characters, it does not have a setting, it ends with a punchline."

"Ok, I am ready to get your TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has two characters, does not have an explicit setting, and ends with a punchline."

"I’m sorry, your connection has timed out. Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"
